##### File Operations Program in C

This C program provides a menu-driven interface for basic file operations. The program allows the user to:

- Create a new file and write text into it.
- Read the contents of an existing file.
- Append text to an existing file.
- Delete a file.
- Exit the program.

The program ensures proper error handling for file operations (e.g., when the file doesn't exist) and uses appropriate input/output functions to perform the required tasks.
